      "description": "This festive collection of bright orange filter-feeding brisingid sea stars and scavenging sea urchins were found on a rocky seamount about 700 meters (~2,300 feet) deep in the Phoenix Islands Protected Area. Brisingids are highly modified sea stars that use their clawed spines to act as velcro to capture tiny prey as food. The mission to explore this remote region in the central Pacific was led by Erik Cordes, Randi Rotjan and WHOI’s Tim Shank aboard the Schmidt Ocean Institute‘s R/V Falkor.

      "description": "A large school of bigeye trevally swim past a submarine carrying WHOI scientists descending in Cabu Pulmo National Park on the east coast of Mexico’s Baja California Peninsula. Overfishing had decimated pelagic and reef fishes here, but populations have returned after a marine reserve was established in 2005. Along with overfishing, coral reefs are also under threat from climate change and ocean acidification. MIT-WHOI Joint Program graduate student Nathaniel Mollica has used numerical modeling to show that the ocean’s decreasing pH is making it harder for corals to build their skeletons and leaving them more vulnerable to breaking.

WHOI microbiologist Amy Apprill is studying how microscopic life such as bacteria, and algae interact with corals to scavenge for nutrients, remove waste and perform other jobs. This new way of looking at corals is similar to the way some scientists look at humansas complex superorganisms that incorporate microbes in symbiotic collaborations.

      "description": "This coral’s stark white color indicates that it is stressed, probably by warming water. Most corals host a type of algae that produce food for the live coral polyps and that also give reefs their vibrant color. As water temperature rises, corals often eject their algae, making the underlying white skeleton visible, and putting them at risk of starvation and death. This process is called coral bleaching, and it is increasingly common as global warming affects ocean temperatures worldwide. But it can also be mitigated by things such as ocean currents and the resilience of some coral species themselves. (Photo by Amy Apprill, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution)"

The skeleton is made up of millions of tiny crystals of calcium carbonate that behave like prisms and refract the light from the microscope. For scale, the width of the black holes on the skeleton are roughly 100 microns. (Photo by Anne Cohen, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution)"
